    "__NOT-THAT-USEFUL__: This is stuff that I rarely use. Other programmers might use it so it's useful to see if it crops up in any code you might be reading. I tend to think of these as maybe slight oddities that have been included in python for reasons I don't quite understand. I don't advise learning this particualarly but it's useful to know it exists. The reasons I typically don't use these ideas is becuase they make stuff harder to read and often there are other ways that are more cannon __or__ they are super super useful but only in very particular cases that I've found myself comming acorss very rairly.\n",

    "- use of destructuring-assignment in the for loop. This is the other time I use destructuring-assignment all the time. outside of iterating through `enumerate`, `zip` or `items` iterables it doesn't come up that much. This is wy it's included as __USEFUL__ becuase of it's relevent to these contexts.\n",
    "- unlike `zip` and `enumerate`, which you use in the form `enumerate(list)`, `items` is a method on the dictionary itself so you use it like `dictionary.items()`. I'm not sure why this is exactly but i'd guess it has to do with the fact that enumerate is useable on any iterable object not just lists. whereas items() is something you do only to dictionarys. Just be wary of the difference."
